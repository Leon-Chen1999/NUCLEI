For extension, I make two functions. One of them is MINUS function, it is something like PLUS function, and it is easily to finish.
Here is the formula of the MINUS function.
(SET A '2')
(SET B(MINUS A '1' ))

And another function is APPEND. It is similiar with CONS but has many differents. Here is the formula.
The append procedure appends two (or more) lists to one another. Because Lisp lists are linked lists, appending two lists has asymptotic time complexityO(n) 
But I didn't finish it,It has some error in the last output.
(append '(1 2) '(3 4))
 ;Output: (1 2 3 4)
 (append '(1 2 3) '() '(a) '(5 6))
 ;Output: (1 2 3 a 5 6)
